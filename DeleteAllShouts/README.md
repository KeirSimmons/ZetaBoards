## Description

There is no easy way to delete all shoutbox messages without manually going through each and clicking `(x)`. This code gives the ability to prune all messages at the click of a button, to help with wiping spam bots, or simply starting-over. This option is restricted to those who have access to the Report CP (moderators and admins). To prevent accidentally deleting all messages, there is a confirmation message before anything happens.
